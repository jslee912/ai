Turtles are reptiles that have a hard shell consisting of a shell and a shell that protects the body. About 300 species are known worldwide and live in various environments such as land, sea, and rivers. Land-based turtles eat mostly plant-based food, while sea turtles eat algae and marine invertebrates. Turtles breathe through their lungs and, since they are thermostatic animals, their body temperature changes according to their surrounding temperature. That is why you can often see them regulating their body temperature while basking in the sun.
Turtles reproduce by laying eggs, and females lay eggs in leaves or sand and do not protect them until they hatch. Eggs have a unique characteristic that male and female ratios during hatching vary depending on natural temperatures. Turtles are very long, so they can live for decades to more than 100 years, depending on the species. For example, Galapagos turtles are known to survive for more than 150 years.
For many years, turtles have been regarded as a slow but steady symbol, signifying wisdom and longevity in many cultures. However, due to habitat destruction, illegal capture, and plastic pollution, many species are facing the danger of extinction recently. In the case of sea turtles, spawning areas are reduced due to coastal development, and marine waste is often mistaken for food and life is often threatened. To solve this problem, each country is continuing conservation efforts by designating protected areas and operating hatchery.
